				<h2>Public VPN</h2>
				<p>A VPN, or Private Virtual Network, is a protocol that allows the routing of all the external traffic of a machine to another.</p>

				<h2>MAC Changing</h2>
				<p>Changing your MAC address constantly would ensure that your physical device cannot be matched with your identity online and locally.</p>

				<h2>Change the Hostname</h2>
				<p>Changing your hostname allows you to hide an identifier on your local network and some applications.</p>

				<h2>Fake Traffic Generation</h2>
				<p>Creating fake traffic that looks legit to most observers is a way to bypass suspicious traffic detection by blending genuine
				traffic with a fake one.</p>

				<h2>Decoy Files</h2>
				<p>Just as deleted files can be recovered, another anti-forensics measure is to create decoy files to focus the attention on
				purposefully deleted but recoverable files.</p>

				<h2>Securely Remove Files</h2>
				<p>The true way to delete a file is thereby to overwrite its content first and then disregard the file as unallocated disk space.
				Our secure delete files feature does just that.</p>

				<h2>Host File Blocking</h2>
				<p>By putting domain names associated with a blocklist, like known tracking domains, and associating them with your localhost address,
				i.e., your device, you are blocking these domains system-wide. This is because when looking for these domain's IP addresses, your system
				will look for the entries in the HOST file before any DNS request.</p>

				<h2>Javascript</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in websites today to provide advanced features and dynamic content.
				However, JavaScript is also probably the biggest security risk in a browser as a lot of attacks utilize JavaScript. JavaScript
				is also responsible for a lot of web browser fingerprinting techniques today.</p>

				<h2>Web Fingerprinting</h2>
				<p>The ad networks figured out that tracked advertising is more effective advertising because a user is keener on clicking an ad for
				something that he can relate to. Because of that, ad networks pursued the tracking and fingerprinting of users online.</p>
